Linked List Implementations in C

This repository contains three separate implementations of Linked Lists in C:

🧵 Singly Linked List (singlyll.c)

🔁 Doubly Linked List (doublyll.c)

🔄 Circular Singly Linked List (circularll.c)

Each file supports basic operations such as:

Insertion (start, middle, end)

Deletion (start, middle, end)

Displaying the current list

🔧 How to Compile & Run

Use gcc to compile each file individually:

gcc singlyll.c -o sll
./sll

gcc doublyll.c -o dll
./dll

gcc circularll.c -o cll
./cll
